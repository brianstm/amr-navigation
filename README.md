## Description
This repository contains the navigation package for the botXplorer Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR), a project developed by Singapore Polytechnic and SICK Pte. Ltd., Singapore. The botXplorer AMR is a revamped and remade version of the Ubiquity Silver Magni Bot, equipped with the SICK TiM781 LiDAR Sensor.

## Overview

The navigation stack of the botXplorer AMR is based on ROS 1 Noetic. It utilizes the Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) package for localization and the move_base package for navigation. To enhance localization, we have integrated the SICK Lidar Localization from SICK.

## Documentation
